This is the backend to an app to create short videos.
You can use file1.py first and subtitle.py file second.
File1.py generates a short with video and subtitle.py overlays them, moviepy documentation for subtitles is slightly confusing and perhaps missing some important details so you can also refer this file for editing purposes
